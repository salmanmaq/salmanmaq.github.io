								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

<p>I just finished my year as a Technical Student at CERN as part of the INSPIRE-HEP collaboration where I was working on Machine Learning methods for textual data and for aiding information retrieval. My research interests include the development of Artificial General Intelligence and Medical Analytics.</p>

<p>I also completed my Masters in Robotics and AI at <a href="http://www.nust.edu.pk">National University of Sciences and Technology</a> last year, where I worked on my thesis on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation with <a href="http://www.nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Schools/SMME/Departments/RIME/Faculty/Pages/Dr.-Hasan-Sajid.aspx">Dr. Hasan Sajid</a> at the <a href="http://cvml.io">Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML) Lab</a>. During my Masters degree, I also worked at the TUKL-NUST R&D Centre at my institute on fish detection and classification with <a href="http://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/shafait.html">Dr. Faisal Shafait</a> and <a href="http://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/ahmadsalman.html">Dr. Ahmad Salman</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I completed my Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from the same institute. But after working in the industry for a few months, I decided to switch to Computer Science to have the opportunity to do more meaningful and creative work.</p>

								<p><b> Technical Student @ CERN (INSPIRE-HEP)</b><br />
									- Prototyped, evaluated, and integrated a 3-class [Core High Energy Physics, Non-Core, Rejected] publication classifier with inspire-next. It uses title, abstract, as well as Core and Non-Core first order and second order reference fractions as input and is based on the ULMFiT text classifier. This, in turn, saves significant curation time to classify all publications harvested from arXiv.<br />
									- Integrated the heirarchical clustering based author disambiguation module with the main inspire application. The module used author names, the name vairants, the name initials, as well as the potential author ethnicity to cluster the same authors together.<br />
									- Did analysis and visualization for the results of the newly prototyped ElasticSearch queries based reference matcher. This lead to identification to various issues with the matcher and the queries which we corrected. We finally integrated the new reference matcher with the main application to get a boost over the previous rule-based reference matcher.<br />

									</ul>
								</p>

								<p><b> Computer Vision and Machine Learning (CVML) Lab @ NUST </b><br />
									- Worked on the semantic Segmentation of Medical Images for Laparoscopic Surgery using Deep Learning.<br />
									- Built a new dataset (m2caiSeg) encompassing 19 classes including various organs and surgical instruments involved in Cholecystectomy.<br />
									- Prototyped and exprimented with various Deep Learning based methods for Semantic Segmentation on low qaunity of labeled data including self-supervised pre-training, Capsule Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, as well as using simulated data.<br />
									- Developed and publised a novel method on people counting in dense crowds using a sparse head detections.<br />
								</p>

								<p><b> Summer Student @ CERN (ATLAS and CLIC)</b><br />
									- Contributed to the development of the <a href="https://project-allpix-squared.web.cern.ch/project-allpix-squared/">allpix-squared</a> software, a framework for simulation of beam telescopes, and added various detector and telescope configurations to the software.<br />
									- Implemented the General Broken Lines track reconstruction algorithm, and integrated it with the Proteus track reconstruction software.<br />
									- The project report can be found <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2291166">here</a>.<br />
								</p>

								<p><b> TUKL-NUST R&D Centre </b><br />
									- Developed algorithms for fish detection including using Optical Flow, Gaussian Mixture Models, Pixel-wise Posteriors, and Deep Learning based methods.<br />
									- Designed and manufactured a data collection rig for collecting fish videos in Pakistani rivers and lakes.<br />
								</p>

	              <p><b> NUST-SMME RISE Research Centre </b><br />
									- Implemented the Hector SLAM algorithm on the Robotic Wheelchair platform at the lab using ROS.<br />
