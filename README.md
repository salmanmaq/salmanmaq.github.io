## Hello World

I am a 2nd year graduate student of Robotics and Intelligent Machines Engineering (RIME) at School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (SMME) at National University of Science and Technology (NUST), Pakistan. Previously, I completed my mechanical engineering from the same institute, but my interests have since then moved on to Computer Science.

My research interests are Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

## Affiliations

In addition to my graduate studies, I am a researcher at TUKL-NUST Research Development Centre at NUST School where I am working on fish detection and classification from underwater video feeds.

## Projects

- Semantic segmentation of medical images
- Head detection using ConvNets for dense crowd density estimation
- Fish detection and classification (TUKL-NUST R&D Centre)
- Hector SLAM implementation on robotic wheelchair (NUST-SMME RISE Research Centre)
